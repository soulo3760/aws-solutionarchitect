tape ggateeway 
### storage gateway
### snowball devices that have tape gateway 
aws snowball migrates terabytes to cloud in 4-6 days 
  - can even launch ec2instances 
  - snowball edge compute optimized/ storage optimized
  - power on and connect to your network


local zones, 
place compute, storage, database and other AWS service close to end users.
it can be used to bring cloer to users highly demand application requiring single digit response

AWS wavelngth  zones
enables developers to build applications that deliver low latest to mobile devices
and end users.

aws outposts
if you want to set up your own aws datacenter
being native aws infrastructure and operationg models to virtually tany data center and on premise
facility and use api tools


stateful application means it can tolerate failure and restart
stateles means it can withstand failure and disruptions.

Each AZ has it own secueity and independent power but are connected via internet for redundancy with 
ultra-low latency.

EC2 Instnace purchasing options
on demand instances- pay by the second for the instance you launch
saving plan... consistent usage per hour for a term of 1-3 years
reserved instances- reduces ec2 cots by commitment to consistent instance configuration type and region for 1-3 years
        ----------- run continously
spot instnaces- reduce unused ec2 instances can be reducen costs signficnantly - can be disrupted when bid price goes above 1 dolllar...
          ---needs one to be flexible on when app runs and they can interrrupted.
dedicated hosts-- pay for a physcial host to run you instances - soft licenes, per core, per -socket reduce costs
          --- best of compliance requirements and reduce cost of licenses.

dedicated instances pay bu the hour for instances that run on single tenant hardware
capacity reservations- reserve capacity for your ec2 for a specific AZ for any duration




EC2 instance is not a managed services
Labda, dynamoDB table  and Amazon RDS is a managed service 

EFS offered shared storage can be attacjed to different instances.

EBS is attached to one EC2 instance, nitro instances ...
EBS encryption does not allow you to select its kms MANAGED 
S3 encrpts all object uploads to all buckets... 
S3 is not a hierachical directory structure, not a shared storage or attached to ec2 instances

semi-structured data --json 
EMR- run and scale big data workloads. data processing and cloud big data solution.
Amazon Athena is used to query s3- analyze data, fast performance - serveless
AWS glue - prepate and intergrate your data at scale on S3 - write to redshift 
AWS lake formation- can be used with redshift to enrich s3 data, it collect and cleans data for modelling
