....
in a aws organization, billing information on member must not be accessible to anyone 
including the root user of the member accounts.. SCP to the roor OU 
...
cross account access...
trust policy of the role in the production account, add development account as principal
--
tag based access control to authorize and grant cross acoount permissions 
for the required data. 

improving latency when uploading or downloading from S3 - use S3 with TRansfer accelerators
to host the application upto gigabytes in size. 

SCP 

Reliability multi-AZ and auto scalling and ALB 


Application uses amazon COGNITO as an indentity provider to authenticate users and return a JSON Web Token. 
that provides access to protected resources stored in another s3 bucket
amazon congito indentity pool can assume proper iam role for access to protected content. 




s3 is like google drive

Sheiled advanced and WAF can prevent DDOS 

WAF associate with ALB and configure rate limiting rule 




local zones, 
place compute, storage, database and other AWS service close to end users.
it can be used to bring cloer to users highly demand application requiring single digit response

AWS wavelngth  zones
enables developers to build applications that deliver low latest to mobile devices
and end users.

aws outposts
if you want to set up your own aws datacenter
being native aws infrastructure and operationg models to virtually tany data center and on premise
facility and use api tools


stateful application means it can tolerate failure and restart
stateles means it can withstand failure and disruptions.

Each AZ has it own secueity and independent power but are connected via internet for redundancy with 
ultra-low latency.

EC2 Instnace purchasing options
on demand instances- pay by the second for the instance you launch
saving plan... consistent usage per hour for a term of 1-3 years
-  -  -     compute savings plan 

reserved instances- reduces ec2 cots by commitment to consistent instance configuration type and region for 1-3 years
        ----------- run continously

spot instnaces- reduce unused ec2 instances can be reducen costs signficnantly - can be disrupted when bid price goes above 1 dolllar...
          ---needs one to be flexible on when app runs and they can interrrupted.

dedicated hosts-- pay for a physcial host to run you instances - soft licenes, per core, per -socket reduce costs
          --- best of compliance requirements and reduce cost of licenses.

dedicated instances pay bu the hour for instances that run on single tenant hardware
capacity reservations- reserve capacity for your ec2 for a specific AZ for any duration


private subnets are secured and not accessible to outside services
routing table of the private submtet can be congigured to route the outbound traffic
to an AWS network firewall. configure domain list rule groups.
